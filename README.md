# Hostel Mate
• Hostel residents’ lives made simpler and more convenient by this app. First‑hand experience creating a practical application for a real life problem.
• Features like Laundromat Availability check, Bus Schedule, SOS, Complaint register etc are the main features of this app
• I’ve worked complete on the backend of the project and also developed the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design of the app.
Moving ahead with the Firebase part of the project I used Firebase Authentication to implement secure user authentication and authorization features. Using Firebase cloud‑ firestore worked on all the other features like laundromat Availability, Bus schedule etc.
